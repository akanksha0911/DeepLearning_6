 Practice transfer learning and supervised contrastive learning
 
 Part 1 - supervised contrastive learning  - Using new loss 
Write a colab to demonstrate supervised contrastive learning loss based supervised classification versus regular softmax based one


Part 2 - Transfer learning on various modalities : 
Write simple colabs to transfer learn on images, videos, audios -  - with both as a feature extractor as well as a fine tuning usecases

Part 3 - Zero shot transfer learning in colab
